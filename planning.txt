********You have been asked to build a secure and scalable RESTful API that allows users to create, read, update, and delete notes.

2. Use a database of your choice to store the data (preferably MongoDB or PostgreSQL).
3. Use any authentication protocol
4. Implement search functionality to enable users to search for notes based on keywords. ( preferably text indexing for high performance )
5. rite unit tests and integration tests your API endpoints using a testing framework of your choice.
